# sea-turtle-nesting-study-2020_2024
This repository presents an independent data analysis of sea turtle nesting trends observed along Florida’s east and west coasts between 2020 and 2024. The project explores spatial and temporal patterns in nest counts across multiple species, offering insight into regional differences and broader conservation implications.

## Project Summary
Sea turtles are a keystone species whose nesting activity offers valuable ecological insight into the health of marine environments. This analysis examines publicly available nesting count data across Florida's coastal survey sites over a 5-year span.

Goals of the analysis:
- Compare nesting trends across regions (east vs. west coast)
- Visualize interannual changes and species distribution
- Identify potential outliers or data quality issues
- Provide a clean and reproducible workflow for future biological monitoring efforts

## Data Overview
- Source: Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) datasets (public access)
- Years covered: 2020 to 2024
- Species included: Loggerhead (Caretta caretta), Green turtle (Chelonia mydas), and Leatherback (Dermochelys coriacea)
- Metrics: Total nests per species per location, coastline region, and year
  
## Tools and Technology
- **R** (v4.3)  
- Tidyverse (dplyr, ggplot2, tidyr)  
- readr and lubridate for data handling  
- Base R for summarization and quality checks  
- PDF report compiled with R Markdown

## Repository Structure
- `Sea_Turtle_Nesting_Florida_2020_2024.pdf`: Final report summarizing the project’s findings and data visualizations
- Data and code are available upon request (or hosted privately to maintain source data rights)

## Key Insights
- Loggerheads consistently represent the majority of nests across both coasts, though Green turtle nesting surged on the east coast in 2023
- West coast locations show lower but more consistent nesting totals across species
- The number of Leatherback nests remained low, consistent with known patterns
- Year-to-year fluctuations may relate to climate variation or local conservation actions
